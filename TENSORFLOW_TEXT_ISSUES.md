# TensorFlow Text Installation Issues

## Problem
TensorFlow Text is an optional dependency that may not be available for all Python versions or platforms.

## Common Issues
1. **Version Compatibility**: tensorflow-text requires specific TensorFlow versions
2. **Platform Support**: Not available for all operating systems/architectures
3. **Python Version**: May not support newer Python versions immediately

## Solutions

### Option 1: Skip TensorFlow Text (Recommended)
The system works perfectly without tensorflow-text. It's only needed for advanced text processing features.

### Option 2: Try Alternative Installation
```bash
# Try installing with specific version
pip install tensorflow-text==2.15.0

# Or try installing tensorflow first
pip install tensorflow
pip install tensorflow-text
```

### Option 3: Use Different Python Version
TensorFlow Text often works better with Python 3.9-3.11

## Impact
- **Without tensorflow-text**: System works normally, all core features available
- **With tensorflow-text**: Some advanced text processing features may be enhanced

## Recommendation
**Skip tensorflow-text installation** - the system is designed to work without it.
